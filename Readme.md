# Tinker Hub Submission

This repo consists of a dart program for the problem statement mentioned below:

Write a dart class for tech learners and mentors. Should have following methods

addStacks() : Add a particular stack of interest/expertise

setMentorOrLearner() : Set whether the participant is learner or mentor

setAvailableTime() : if person is mentor set available time

getMentor() : Takes stack and time as params and finds available mentors. 


# Keep in mind

After running the program at first add the mentors, then only add the participants.

The program is made with few assumption

1. At a purticular time there will be only one mentor for each track.
2. Learners know the time at which thier mentors are available.
